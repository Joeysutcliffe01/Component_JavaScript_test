Prefixbox JS Task:


When you open “result_page.html” in a browser, you will see a search results page with 6 products.

Your task will be to make the “Show only discounted products” checkbox and the sorting dropdown functional on the page.

In the folder, you will also find two GIFs. By opening these, you can see the expected functionality.

(“1_only_discounted_products.gif”, “2_sorting.html”)

Preferably, do not modify the HTML file!

**Edits to the HTLM file:
**I add a new a new url for Komodo because the ordignal url was not working.
**I added the result_page.html file from the css homework to the javascript homework. 
**I also added a link to the js file
